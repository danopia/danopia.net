<% content_for :title, 'Personal Statement' %>

<p>My name is Daniel Lamando, but I normally go by <tt>danopia</tt> on the Internet. One of my favorite things (besides math) is computer programing. I attended Buena Regional High School in the class of 2011. I will attend Drexel University in Philly for Computer Engineering, class of 2016. Most of the software that I use and create is open source, and I am also a proponent of open standards and formats.</p>

<p>Beyond the realm of computing, I do a bunch of other things with my life, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Play tuba in the school marching/concert band</li>
  <li>Compete in Math League and Academic Team</li>
  <li>Work in a car maintenance garage</li>
  <li>Read a bunch of books, mostly fantasy (such as Eragon) and other fiction</li>
  <li>Listen to a lot of music (though country is my favorite)</li>
</ul>
